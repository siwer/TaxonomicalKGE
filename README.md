# TaxonomicalKGE
This repository contains the Code for the joint-learning approach from our paper *Embedding Taxonomical, Situational or Sequential Knowledge Graph Context for Recommendation Tasks* which will be presented at the upcoming (2021) Semantics conference (https://2021-eu.semantics.cc/).

Information on how to access the necessary data to run the experiments will be provided soon.
